	<h3><u>Biography:</u></h3>
	<p>
	Jacob Leibowitz is a composer and bassist, who takes pride in his ability to shape his audience’s experience through time, both through the mediums of sound/silence and through visuals that are present in his music videos and some of his live pieces.
	</p>
	<p>
	After participating in New York Youth Symphony’s composition program, he continued his studies at the Manhattan School of Music under the guidance of Dr. J. Mark Stambaugh and Dr. Reiko Fueting. In 2021, Jacob won a commission from The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America, to write his composition, <a href="https://youtu.be/1kS_W_aXI5s">Fractured Chronology,</a> for Claire Janezic, based on the idea of clock time (as opposed to duration).
	</p>
	<p>
	Currently Jacob is making his way in the world as a composer, bassist, singer, conductor, and <a href="https://www.recordingandaudio.com/">sound engineer,</a> and focusing his time on his high energy music and video projection, duo, <a href="https://www.psychedelicsupersocks.org/">Psychedelic Super Socks.</a>
