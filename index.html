<h3 class=bio><u>Biography</u><h3>
<p class=bio>
Jacob Leibowitz is a 20 year old composer and bassist who maintains an artist’s idealism in an un-ideal world. He believes in the importance of questioning one’s conditions/environment, and endeavors to go out of his comfort zone with each piece he writes. Jacob has a fascination with the non-virtuosic, as well as with the interactions that take place between performers. Both of these ideas are present in several of his compositions.
</p>
<p class=bio>
Jacob took part in the esteemed New York Youth Symphony’s composition program, and in the future hopes to tour his music with an ensemble of his making. In the meantime he is focused on getting the most out of his undergraduate studies at the Manhattan School of Music under the guidance of Dr. Reiko Fueting.
